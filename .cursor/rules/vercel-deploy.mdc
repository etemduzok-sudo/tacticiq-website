# Vercel Deployment Rules

## CRITICAL: Never use `vercel deploy` command

The TacticIQ website is deployed via **Git push only**. 

### Correct Deployment Method:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

This triggers automatic deployment on the `tacticiq-website` Vercel project.

### NEVER DO:
- `vercel --prod`
- `vercel deploy`
- Creating `.vercel` folder manually
- Deploying from `website` folder directly

### Why:
- `vercel deploy` creates a separate project called "website"
- The correct project is `tacticiq-website` which is connected to GitHub
- Only git push triggers the correct deployment

### Vercel Projects:
- ✅ `tacticiq-website` - Correct (Git-connected, auto-deploy on push)
- ❌ `website` - Wrong (manual deploy, do not use)

If `.vercel` folder exists in `c:\TacticIQ\website\`, delete it immediately.
